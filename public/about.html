<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>my name is Faith, i went to live with my aunt in the city when i was five years old. i dont flow with my family
  that much maybe it because i never really get to know them and it's really affecting me now. i remember when i lost 
  my elder brother, it's was really painful because we didn't get to really bond well as family, he was always there 
  for me when ever i needed him buh i was never there for him. i remember those times he use to tell me to come visit
  them, i go sometimes while other times i don't go.</p>
<p>i which i was very close to him i would have adviced him not to go on that trip because my heart wasn't fully insupport
of the trip maybe he would have listen to me because h3 loves me that much and he breaks my heart to learn that i was the 
major reason he went on that trip. i miss you so much brother OMORUYI and you will forever remain in my heart.</p>

<p>there was a time i felt so ashamed of my body like i dislike my body so much, after further reflection i just 
  discovered that i might have been very stupid then to dislike this precious body of mine, gurl i'm a queen, 
  i'm a 10/10, no one comes close, i'm a full package, GOD really took out his time to create me </p>

<p>as you all know i'm into printing, i make gift items, jotters, 3d shirt & gown, customized nylon, souvenir,and 
  many other printing related stuffs. please try and patronize my little business and as you do that GOD will continue 
  to bless you all and keep you safe. </p>
